## SPCI! (Self Planting Crop Items)
_**originally wanting to make crops automated, turned out to be a cute way to plant food!**_

Any seeds (and vegetables) in dropped form that end up over farmland will plant themselves!

Either throw seeds yourself, or put dispensers to do all the job!

### Supports Farmer's Delight!
**Cabbage Seeds**, **Tomato seeds**, and **Onions** can be Planted!

And **Rich Soil** can be used to plant all crops!
